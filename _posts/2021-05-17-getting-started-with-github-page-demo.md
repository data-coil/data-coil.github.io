# Getting Started With GitHub Page (Demo)
(This was just a demo, please go to [this](https://q-viper.github.io/2020/09/18/why-do-i-regret-not-knowing-about-gitHub-pages-earlier/) blog for original contents.)

Hello everyone this is Viper and in this blog I will be writing about how can we make our own static blogging platform using GitHub page and Jekyll. So there are few things for us to do before writing the first blog.

$$ (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab +b^2 $$

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2} * m * v^2 $$

$$ mean = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{m} x_i}{m} $$ 

$$ \delta{w} = -E $$
